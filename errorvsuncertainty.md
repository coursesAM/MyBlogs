# Error vs Uncertainty

Those unversed with uncertainty often tend to think of uncertainty and errors interchangeably. However, they are not the same.
I came across the following definitions from the AIAA guidelines (AIAA G-007-1998):

*Uncertainty* is defined as:

*A potential deficiency in any phase or activity of the modelling process that is due to lack of knowledge.* 

whereas *Error* is defined as:

*A recognizable deficiency in any phase or activity of modelling and simulation that is not due to lack of knowledge.* 

The key difference between uncertainty and error is the *lack of knowledge*.

The keyword in the definition of **uncertainty** is *potential*, which indicates that deficiences may or may not exist.
